/* for github  

The main focus of this project is how to 
showcase your profession or skills in a portfolio.
There are many different ways to do it, 
but my idea is to rotate the words (UI Designer, UX Designer, Web Developer,etc)
in a fixed place.

here i have used 
animation property::::::
this specify the animation duration property, otherwise the duration is 0, 
and will never be played.
Property names that are prefixed with --, 
represent custom properties that contain a value that can be 
used in other declarations using the var() function.


var function::: 
var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.


transform-origin property :::: 
The transform-origin property allows you to change the position 
of transformed elements.
2D transformations can change the x- and y-axis of an element. 
3D transformations can also change the z-axis of an element.


@keyframes rule::: 
The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code.
the syntax is->

@keyframes animationname{keyframes-selector{css-styles;}}

for example:> @keyframes animation{from {top: 0px;}
                                   to {top: 100px;}}

'from' is 0% and 'to' is 100%
we can also set that, at what percent what will happen.

Note: Just remember that whatever percent you takes it always related to time you've taken.
    so you've to set accordingly.

i have selected total of 24s of animation.
5%, 10%, 20%, 25% this all are related to time 24s, it means while the rotation 
of words at what percent the style changes.


opacity::: 
opacity 1 is default (fully visible),
if you want to show less visible text or image, so you have to decrease the
value, for example(0.2, 0.5, etc).



tranform property ::::
I have also used tranform property, to translateY-axis and rotate the words.
